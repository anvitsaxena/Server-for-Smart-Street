# Server-for-Smart-Street

This repository is created to include the nodeserver.js file that has all the REST API's written for 
project SmartStreet Application. This is basically the backend server which is connected to my Heroku cloud account. 
Heroku need a json file to download all dependencies and hence package.json file is included alongwith the nodeserver.js file in this repository.
